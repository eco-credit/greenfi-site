  <h2>Case Studies</h2>

  <h3>1. Mkuba (Tanzania)</h3>
  <p>
    The Mkuba project is operated by Mwambao/MCCC Ltd, initially on Pemba and Zanzibar Islands 
    and now on the mainland coast of Tanzania too. This was the first time the
    we experimented with eco-credit funds managed by informal financial self-help groups rather than formal financial institutions.
    The project has operated since 2018 and currently supports 200 groups. 
    Groups attach a variety of environmental requirements to loan terms, including use of legal fishing gear, 
    respect for seasonal closures, application of by-laws, 
    attendance at meetings, environmental awareness raising, reporting of infractions, patrols, 
    mangrove planting, and beach clean-ups. Mwambao have ensured that groups are linked to 
    local community-based natural resource management institutions to that environmental activities are coordinated 
    across common pool resources. A video explaining the approach is available below, and Mkuba's own website is 
  <a href="https://mwambao.or.tz/eco-credit-model/" target="_blank">here</a>.

  <h3>2. Kwale Eco-Credit Project (Kenya)</h3>
  <p>
  The Kwale Eco-Credit Project is run by COMRED along the coastline of Kwale County in Kenya. 
  It started in 2021 and has established 32 groups. The main activities are mangrove propagule planting and beach clean-ups. 
  COMRED have experimented with capitalisation of groups via direct cash grants and also grants for purchase of 
  income generating assets. Income from these assets is then used to capitalise groups. This project has been widely covered in

  <h3>3. Nyandarua Eco-Credit Project (Kenya)</h3>
  <p>
    The Nyandarua Eco-Credit Project is managed by Dr Obadiah Ngigi for Greenfi in Nyandarua County. 
    It began in 2020 with four groups, of which three are still operating. The focus has been on 
    on-farm tree planting and simple soil conservation measures. The project runs as a stand-alone 
    effort rather than being embedded in an institution with groups self-determining environmental activities
    they wish to participate in.

  <h3>4. Nature Fundi (Tanzania)</h3>
  <p>
  Nature Fundi is implemented in Mbeya Region by Rikolto Tanzania and the Tanzanian Informal 
  Microfinance Association of Practitioners (TIMAP). Funding is provided by the REDAA fund, 
  managed by IIED on behalf of FCDO. The project has capitalised 42 groups with funding in place to 
  fund a further 58 groups. The focus of this project is adoption of sustainable farming practices by group
  members, with groups self-determining the specific practices they wish to adopt and which are appropriate to local 
  farms. An interview with the Rikolot project manager describing the project is below and the REDAA description of the project is available

  <h3>5. Sea Sense (Tanzania)</h3>
  <p>
  Sea Sense is a local NGO working on the Tanzanian coast, with funding to support 19 community groups. 
  The project promotes the use of legal fishing gear, mangrove planting, and beach clean-ups, while also 
  supporting sustainable livelihoods linked to conservation. In 2024, their efforts included the planting of 
  over 57,000 mangroves and active participation by community groups in protecting coastal ecosystems. 
  The Sea Sense website is available <a href="https://seasense.or.tz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>,
