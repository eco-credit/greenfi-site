  <h2><i data-lucide="landmark"></i>Community Eco-Credit</h2>
  

  <p>
    <strong>Greenfi.org first designed and later piloted the "community eco-credit model" with NGO partners in several agricultural and coastal contexts.</strong> 
     </p> 
       <p>
    <strong>The Greenfi.org project now shares open-source knowledge and tools 
    which support use of the community eco-credit model by informal 
    financial self-help groups</strong>, such as savings groups and chamas. The approach gives groups a self-owned and 
    self-managed green financial instrument, intended to integrate and build local environmental and financial wealth.

 <h3><i data-lucide="leaf"></i>What is community eco-credit?</h3>  
  <p>  
    <strong>"Eco-credit" is a loan which requires borrowers to undertake activities which protect or restore nature 
    alongside loan repayment.</strong> Nature protection activities can include soil conservation measures, 
    tree and mangrove planting or fisheries protection. Loans may serve any purpose and are not limited to financing nature restoration or protection activities. 
    Eco-credit is a simple green financial instrument designed to integrate environmental and financial value, 
    helping to restore the balance between financial and natural capital.
    
  </p>
  <strong>"Community eco-credit" places a revolving credit facility, called an "eco-credit fund", 
    in the hands of informal financial self-help groups.</strong> These groups are often known as savings groups, chamas, or by other local names.
    The eco-credit fund is self-owned and self-managed, and through the issuance of eco-credit loans, meets ongoing small credit needs 
    as well as creates a local incentive for nature protection and restoration.

  <h3><i data-lucide="star"></i>Why community eco-credit is important</h3>  
  <p>  
   <strong>People excluded from formal financial channels manage much of the world’s land and seascapes, 
   yet remain least supported with green financial instruments which could derisk and encourage a transition to sustainable resource management 
   practices.</strong> Community eco-credit is a first-of-its-kind green financial instrument, designed specifically for people who rely on informal 
   finance to meet their financial needs, and aiming to create local incentives for nature protection and restoration.
   </p>

   <h3><i data-lucide="trending-up"></i>Progress</h3> 
  <p> 
    <strong>During its development phase, the eco-credit model won numerous innovation awards, 
    including the UN/Morgan Stanley Prize for Climate Change Finance Innovation, and was endorsed by leading governments
    through the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance.</strong>
    Five organisations have used the Greenfi approach to help nearly 300 new and established groups, with 20–30 members 
    each, to operate small revolving eco-credit funds. The methodology is open-source, and designed to be adapted by its users
    and within different contexts.
