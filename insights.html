  <h2>Insights</h2>

  <p>
    Our learning from implementing the community eco-credit model to date is set out in detail in the 
    <a href="assets/docs/whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenfi White Paper</a>. 
    The following points summarise key insights that have emerged from ongoing implementation. These are our understandings that 
    have guided the design and evolution of the model and which continue to shape its application in new contexts.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Credit is fundamental</h3>
  <p>
    Credit operates as a de facto licensing system. It determines who will obtain the resources and working capital to plant, harvest, 
    build and expand - and why. Credit rules shape the nature of economic activity: purely for profit or towards projects that grow 
    environmental and social wealth alongside financial return. When we preferentially extend credit to activities that balance 
    extraction with restoration, we make sustainable economic growth possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Historically, the financial system has steered resources to areas of the economy which have generated the greatest financial 
    returns, underpinning modern prosperity. Now, credit agreements could be rebalanced to guide economic activity and resources 
    toward endeavours that balance financial and environmental wealth creation.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Credit is a social ritual</h3>
  <p>
    Credit is not only a financial instrument but a social act through which trust is extended, futures are imagined, 
    and obligations are formalised. Financial institutions, whether formal or informal, house these rituals. And because credit 
    shapes what the future looks like, its rituals matter. The way we grant or withhold credit determines whose visions 
    of the future become real. The social rituals of eco-credit create a bond (quite literally), reaffirming trust not just between people 
    but also emphasising and placing with high psychological priority, the ecosystems on which wealth depends.
  </p>
  <p>
    The way community eco-credit projects are set up is therefore critical. The process of forming, governing and managing a 
    community-level credit facility is itself the work. It defines the relationships of trust, accountability and shared value 
    that make the system endure beyond the life of any external support.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Technology should enable but not undermine</h3>
  <p>
    Technology should enable the human act of credit creation, not replace it. Credit issuance should not be dehumanised or 
    placed inside a black box where its workings become unintelligible. Where time and resources are constrained, the temptation 
    is to use technology to reduce costs, but this risks undermining the very process by which the future is co-decided within 
    communities. We built a digital recording system to give transparency to outside funders, but found that technology can easily 
    erode the human foundations of credit creation: the conversations, judgments and shared commitments through which people 
    actively create their own future. We recommend maintaining written ledgers that are digitally mirrored, but never replaced.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Local determination and ownership are utmost</h3>
  <p>
    In the community eco-credit model, groups self-determine how funds are managed and how credit and environmental terms are 
    defined. This autonomy is central to both effectiveness and legitimacy. When local groups set their own priorities and 
    conditions, the resulting credit system reflects local realities rather than external narratives and needs. 
    This builds accountability 
    from within, creating ownership over both the financial mechanism and the environmental outcomes it supports.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Small-scale producers are vital but outside of formal financial institutions</h3>
  <p>
    Most small-scale producers who dominate land and seascapes in developing countries operate outside formal financial systems. 
    They manage soil and other natural resources, supply food and materials, and bear significant environmental risk. They need 
    financial instruments designed specifically for them and the circumstances in which they exist: mechanisms that reflect local realities, 
    prioritise flexibility and optionality, and support rather than undermine the stewardship that sustains local ecosystems.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Trade-offs are real</h3>
  <p>
    In complex systems, problems are rarely solved outright; they are moved, transformed or managed. Community eco-credit groups 
    may reduce local environmental damage, yet in doing so may also finance new forms of consumption that create environmental 
    pressures elsewhere, often in ways that are difficult or impossible to quantify. This is an inherent tension in any environmental 
    project that succeeds in creating local wealth, as they must be if they are to remain viable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The eco-credit model recognises these trade-offs and places in local hands the means to determine which resources to protect 
    and how. By making the negotiation of these choices explicit rather than hidden, the model accepts that sustainability is not 
    a static end state but an ongoing process of managing competing needs within real economies and communities.
