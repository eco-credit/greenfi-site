  <h3>What is Community Eco-Credit?</h3>

  <p>
    
    “Community eco-credit” is an experimental, interdisciplinary methodology
    for set-up of locally-owned and managed green revolving credit facilities. 
    These instruments are designed to create 
    economic and behavioural incentives for individuals to participate in voluntary and 
    self-determined actions which protect or restore vital ecosystems.

  <p>
    Since 2017, the methodology has been tested at five pilot sites. 
    Early results indicate that, with sufficient support, members of participating groups 
    increase their contribution to ecological restoration and protection activities, 
    repay loans, steadily increase their funds and gain experience in financial and 
    environmental management. In our theory of change, this activity contributes to the 
    building of community environmental, financial and social health.

  Information about the methodology can be found in the 
  <a href="assets/docs/whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">Greenfi White Paper</a>. 
  It explains the methodology's benefits, costs, risks, and the trade-offs created by 
  using the approach. The White Paper also highlights what is unproven or not yet known, 
  and sets out the key principles that should ideally be followed when using 
  community eco-credit and the reasons for them.

  <h3>What is an eco-credit group?</h3>

  <p>
    
    Community eco-credit groups are self-managed community groups of approximately 
    30 people which own and  run a revolving credit fund which is loaned amongst group members. 
    Groups include requirements for nature protection and restoration in loan terms. 
    Detailed descriptions of the groups, their composition and governance can be found in the 
    White Paper.

  <h3>5-Step Approach to Set-up of Eco-Credit Groups</h3>

  <p>
    
  <h4>1. Group Recruitment</h4>
  <p>Eco-credit groups of c. 25-30 people are recruited, trained & capitalised 
    with a seed grant.
  </p>
  
  <h4>2. Constitution & Planning</h4>
  
  <p>Eco-credit groups agree a group constitution covering group governance, 
    fund rules and credit terms, and a self-determined plan for management of 
    targeted natural resources and associated activities. 
  </p>


  <h4>3. Issue of Loans</h4>
  <p>Eco-credit groups issue loans to members, and the terms of the loan require 
    participation in activities defined at Step 2.</p>


  <h4>4. Repayment & Action</h4>
  <p>The borrower repays the loan and undertakes the required activities.</p>


  <h4>5. Impact Reporting</h4>
  <p>Eco-credit groups track, monitor and report on financial and environmental impact, and are rewarded with further milestone grant payments.
